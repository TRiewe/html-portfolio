<h1> Trent's Favorite Movies</h1>

<h2>I'm just listing three in no particular order</h2>
<hr/>

<h3>Into the Spider-verse</h3>
<p>The artistic stylings of the movie, the animation, sound design, music choices, and voice acting,
are so above and beyond so many other animated movies of our time.</p>

<h3>Dune (2021)</h3>
<p>The way Denis Villeneuve brings alive the book helps make this movie extremely good</p>

<h3>Arrival</h3>
<p>I can't belive I was capivated by a movie about language and how it shapes the way we think</p>
